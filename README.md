## Description



#### Introduction
Many people struggle to meet friends outside of work or school, contributing to an
epidemic of loneliness. For example, 30% of Americans say they feel lonely each week
(https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/news-releases/new-apa-poll-one-in-three-americans-feel
s-lonely-e). Many Americans who have graduated from college struggle to find acquaintances or
people with like interests. Our app seeks to resolve this problem by allowing users to schedule
local “events” at a specific time and place (for example, hiking or fishing trips) that other users
can sign up for and meet other people at. The app will also allow users to communicate with
one another, add friends, and search their geographical area for exciting events.

#### Objectives:
- Provide people with a platform to socialize with one another
- Allow users to create “events” that others can comment on and RSVP
- Design a means for users to see events within a geographical radius of their location.
#### Scope:
- We will include a way to schedule events
- Events will contain the location, time, who planned it, who is going, and a comment
section.
- The ability to direct message other users
- The ability to “friend” other users
- A “feed” page that shows local events
- The ability to filter feed by friends
- Filter feed by distance
- A map view of all the nearby events
#### Proposed Solution:
The purpose of this application is to interconnect and allow for peers to meet one
another outside of intercampus events. This application can help many students, faculty, or even
residents find friends and chat with new people, attend events they didn’t know about, and learn
about the community on a deeper level.
Technology Stack:
- Frontend: Next JS
- Backend: Python FLASK
- Database: MySQL
- Deployment Platform: Vercel for Frontend, Render for Backend
Expected Outcomes:
- Our final deliverable will be working backend and frontend prototype of PlanIt which will
- Allow users to plan and create events
- Allow users to sign up for interesting events
